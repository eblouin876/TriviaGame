# Trivia

## Description
This is a trivia game that gives you options to choose from for categories. The data is pulled off the opentdb API when the player chooses what category the want to play.   

## Languages and Frameworks Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* AJAX

## Instructions
To begin, choose a category from the top. The game will populate with 20 random questions from that category. You will have 10 seconds to answer each question. If you run out of time, the correct answer will be displayed and then will move you on to the next question. At the end, it will display your score and display the categories again to start a new game. 

## Support
If you come across any bugs or have any suggestions to improve the code, please feel free to comment! I would love to improve the code, especially the interfacing with the API.

## Project Status
This project is part of a web development program I am currently enrolled in and is in the works. I will continue to improve upon it over the next few months. Directions at the moment include: 
* Adding a difficulty selector
* Adding a number of questions selector
* Adding more categories
* Adding a time per question selector
* Adding a numerical score based on speed of response.
